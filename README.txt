Project Summary:
	
This program is a choose your own adventure game and playing it is simple.

Your only inputs should be numbers. never characters or symbols.

You'll be greeted by a menu with 3 options. Select 1 to start playing the game. It will greet you with some text about what's happening.
You can then choose a menu option given to go to the next selected area.

If LOSE is displayed in big letters you didn't reach the end

IF WIN is displayed in big letters you reached the very end.

The program will ask you if you wish to keep playing. You can quickly try the program as many times as you'd like.



How To Run:

The game plays through your terminal. Simply execute the PROJECT file with ./project to start the game.
The folder you extract from the zip file I plan to upload should have the following files.

- project.cpp
- header.cpp
- gamedata.txt
- README.txt
- project (executable)

If any files are missing please email me right away!


Dependencies:

The only dependicies are that your computer can compile a simple c++ program like the ones we have run all semeseter.

System Rquirements:

My program was designed an tested on the linux virtual machine. I highly reccommend using linux to try the program out.
